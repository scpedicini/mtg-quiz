## How does it work?

*First the game shows you a random card from the selected edition:*

*As the time ticks down, the progress bar will indicate remaining time. If the time runs out, or you give up, it will reveal the card.*

*After answering a set of questions, it will assign the player a ranking according to their proficiency.*

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation
First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build Commands

Build the production version:
```bash
npm run build
```

Clean the build directory:
```bash
npm run clean
```

Clean and rebuild:
```bash
npm run clean-build
```

### Development

The project uses Gulp for build tasks. The build process:
- Minifies JavaScript files (main.js, editions.js)
- Minifies CSS files
- Minifies JSON card data files
- Copies all assets and libraries to the build directory

To serve the built files locally for testing:
```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start a Python HTTP server on port 8000. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Alternatively, you can use any static file server of your choice to serve the `build/` directory.

### Production Deployment

After running `npm run build`, the entire `build/` directory contains all the files needed for deployment. Simply upload the contents of the `build/` directory to your web server.
